# Higher-Order-From-Scratch

1. Whiteboard, make a code plan and build each of the following methods:
  * .map() - function that takes an array of items and a function that returns an array with each item manipulated by that function.
  * .reduce() - function that takes an array of food orders with their amounts and returns the total amount of all the food orders.
  * .filter() - function that takes an array of items and a function that returns an array with only the items that return true in the function.
2. Create a repo called "Higher-Order-From-Scratch".
3. Practice working from branches by creating a new branch called: "HigherOrder".
4. Place your code in a file called main.js.
5. Create a pull request (PR) for Higher-Order-From-Scratch to be merged into master.
